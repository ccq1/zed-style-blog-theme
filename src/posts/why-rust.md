Rust has been gaining massive popularity in the last few years. As a frontend developer, venturing into systems programming can be daunting, but Rust makes it approachable.

### The Borrow Checker

The most infamous part of Rust is also its greatest strength.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // s1 is moved here
    
    // println!("{}, world!", s1); // This would throw an error!
    println!("{}, world!", s2);
}
```

It forces you to think about memory ownership at compile time, eliminating a whole class of bugs found in C++.

### Performance

It is blazingly fast.
