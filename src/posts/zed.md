The **Zed** editor is interesting because it focuses purely on performance. It is GPU-accelerated and written in Rust.

### Key Features

1.  **Speed**: It opens instantly.
2.  **Collaboration**: Built-in specialized CRDTs for multiplayer coding.
3.  **Minimalism**: The UI gets out of the way.

This blog theme is heavily inspired by their design language: deep blacks, subtle borders, and high-contrast text.
